PCB kicad stm8 se8r01

this is my design in kicad of a pcb which contains a stm8 microcontroller smd component and a SE8R01 wireless device

I send the design of to oshpark and it works! 

The design uses as little components as possible. The led had no resistor, but I use pwm to control it.
I bought everything from a well known chinese website.

The most expensive part was the PCB board -- 7 dollar for 3 boards.
